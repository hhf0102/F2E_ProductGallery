                    <p>In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there is much running backwards and forwards among the
                        crew. Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one place; for at
                        one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description
                        of the scene.
                    </p>
                    <p>We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale's back, the blubber-hook
                        was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as
                        that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as
                        harpooneer.
                    </p>
